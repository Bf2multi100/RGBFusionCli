Updated from CheerPipes RGBFusion project.

Source: 

Piped a .EXE from the projects source code since the project didn't include the necessary files for ordinary users to copy/paste the items needed to process the RGB LEDs without downloading visual studio C# and compiling the code from the source.


Instructions:


To install first have RGBFusion B19.0919.1 installed on machine (uninstall any other version) .ZIP included in fork.

Now, copy the RGBFusionCLI.EXE and RGBFusionCLI.exe.config to the C:\Program Files (x86)\GIGABYTE\RGBFusion folder

Then copy all the .CS files to the C:\Program Files\Aurora\Scripts\Devices folder (if Scripts doesnt exist, make the folder, and make a child folder "devices")


Now try using Aurora and the RGB should light up for your motherboard/gigabyte peripherals.


Update 4-1-21:

Having trouble with auto opening the RGBFusionCLI program automatically, will work on a fix and update this fork.
